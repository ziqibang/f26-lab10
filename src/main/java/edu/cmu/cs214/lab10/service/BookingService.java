/**
 * The room reservation API that the web front end and the kiosk both call.
 *
 * <p>Times are raw minutes from midnight and ranges are half-open, matching
 * {@link Booking}.
 *
 * <p>Thread safety: safe for concurrent use. The service owns no mutable
 * booking state of its own. The room catalog is built once in the constructor
 * and never written again, and every read and write of booking data goes
 * through {@link BookingStore}, whose methods are each synchronized. Each store
 * call is atomic but a sequence of calls is not, so a decision that must hold at
 * the moment of a write has to be one store call, as {@link #book} does with
 * {@link BookingStore#insertIfFree}. The only other field that changes after
 * construction is {@link BookingStats}, and its numbers are documented as
 * approximate.
